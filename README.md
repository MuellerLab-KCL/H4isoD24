# H4isoD24
Custom python and MATLAB code used for fitting kinetic models to high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses of PTM deposition on histone H4 peptides and nucleosome arrays. These scripts were used for the manuscript "Semisynthesis of isomerised histone H4 reveals robustness and vulnerability of chromatin towards molecular ageing".

1) "Analysis of PIMT methylation of peptides.py" was used for PIMT methylation of H4 peptides (Figure S4).
2) "Analysis of methylation cascade on peptides.py" was used for the Set8/Suv4-20h1 methylation cascade on H4 peptides (Figure 5C). Uses data in "DATA_Analysis of methylation cascade on peptides" 
3) "Analysis of methylation cascade on 12-mers.py" was used for the Set8/Suv4-20h1 methylation cascade on nucleosome arrays (Figure 5D). Uses data in "DATA_Analysis of methylation cascade on 12-mers"
4) "Analysis of monomethylation on 12-mers.py" was used for the Set8 monomethylation assay on mixed nucleosome arrays (Figure 5E). Used data in "DATA_Analysis of monomethylation on 12-mers"
5) "H4K20me2_90min_Fraction_VS_k2.m" was used to estimate a limit-of-detection for the Set8/Suv4-20h1 methylation cascade on nucleosome arrays with H4isoD24 (Figure S23).

The data for these analyses can be found in the corresponding data folders.

Instructions for use can be found as comments in the scripts.

Note: All python scripts are optimized to run in the Spyder IDE and may require modification to run in other environments or as standalone scripts.
