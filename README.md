# H4isoD24
Custom python and MATLAB code used for fitting kinetic models to high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses of PTM deposition on H4 peptides and nucleosome arrays. This code was used for the manuscript "X".

1) "Analysis of PIMT methylation of peptides.py" was used for PIMT methylation of H4 peptides (Figure S4).
2) "Analysis of methylation cascade on peptides.py" was used for the Set8/Suv4-20h1 methylation cascade on H4 peptides (Figure 5D).
3) "Analysis of methylation cascade on 12-mers.py" was used for the Set8/Suv4-20h1 methylation cascade on nucleosome arrays (Figure 5E).
4) "H4K20me2_90min_Fraction_VS_k2.m" was used to estimate a limit-of-detection for the Set8/Suv4-20h1 methylation cascade on nucleosome arrays with H4isoD24 (Figure S21).

The data for these analyses can be found in the corresponding data folders.

Instructions for use can be found as comments in the scripts.
