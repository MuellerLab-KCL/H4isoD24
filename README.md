# H4isoD24
Custom python code used for fitting kinetic models to high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses of the Set8/Suv4-20h1 methylation cascade on histone H4 peptides and nucleosome arrays. This code was used for the manuscript "X".

1) "Analysis of methylation cascade on 12-mers.py" was used for methylation reactions with nucleosome arrays.
2) "Analysis of methylation cascade on peptides.py" was used for methylation reactions with peptides.

Instructions for use can be found as comments in the Python files.
